This report is step-wise design and simulation guide for implementing 4-bit carry look-ahead (CLA) adder using CMOS mirror logic in 28nm PDK using Synopsy Custom Compiler tool.
# Abstract 
This paper presents a transistor-level implementation of a 4-bit carry look-ahead (CLA) adder using CMO S mirror logic. CLA adder design overcomes the delay issue in 
conventional RCA adder by eliminating the cascading effect of the carry bits. The sum and carry terms are processed at once in the CLA adder. CMOS mirror logic results in reduced transistor count compared to Static CMOS logic. Further, it uses the same transistor topology for NMO S and PMOS networks which leads to a symmetric layout. Simulations are carried out in 28nm PDK using Synopsy Custom Compiler and PrimeSim tool.
